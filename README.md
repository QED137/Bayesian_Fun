Visulisation of Baysian Estiamte of Posterior Distribution


## Bayesian Inference Visualization

This repository contains Python code for visualizing Bayesian inference using interactive widgets in Jupyter notebooks.

## Overview
I am a big fan of Bayesian inference because it offers significant advantages over frequentist approaches. Bayesian inference is a powerful statistical framework for updating beliefs about parameters in light of new data. This project demonstrates Bayesian updates for different prior distributions (Gaussian, Poisson, Uniform, and Bernoulli) and visualizes how the posterior distribution changes as data is observed
